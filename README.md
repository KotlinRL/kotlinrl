# KotlinRL

**JVM-native Reinforcement Learning Platform in Pure Kotlin**

KotlinRL is a lightweight, production-ready reinforcement learning library designed for adaptive agents running entirely on the JVM.

While most reinforcement learning libraries focus on Python ecosystems, KotlinRL brings RL directly into Kotlin-native microservices, allowing you to embed self-learning agents directly inside your JVM-based applications without the complexity of external training infrastructure.

## High-Level Goals

- ✅ **Pure Kotlin, JVM-native**  
  Fully idiomatic Kotlin, functional design, and JVM-native deployment.

- ✅ **Embedded and Lightweight**  
  Runs directly inside microservices, data pipelines, streaming agents, or real-time control systems.

- ✅ **Extensible, Modular Architecture**  
  Separates core RL algorithms, environments, and training loops.

- ✅ **Open Source (Apache 2.0)**  
  Safe for commercial, academic, and enterprise adoption with zero licensing friction.

## Core Design Goals

KotlinRL enables JVM developers to:

- ✅ **Build sequential decision-making agents** capable of learning optimal behavior through repeated interaction with the environment.
- ✅ **Learn optimal behavior under uncertainty** where outcomes of actions are probabilistic, delayed, or partially observable.
- ✅ **Balance short-term and long-term tradeoffs**, optimizing for cumulative reward rather than myopic, greedy behavior.
- ✅ **Operate in partially observable environments**, where full system state may not be available, and delayed feedback loops exist.
- ✅ **Continuously adapt to runtime environments** through interaction and feedback — learning from success, failure, and system variability.
- ✅ **Train simple RL models directly inside Kotlin projects** without requiring external Python ML infrastructure.
- ✅ **Embed trained agents directly into JVM microservices and production workloads** without cross-language deployment complexity.

---

## KotlinRL complements existing JVM ML projects:

- ✅ KotlinRL focuses on the reinforcement learning loop: agents, environments, rewards, policies, experience buffers, and policy optimization.
- ✅ KTTorch (DJL internal with PyTorch engine) provides neural network training and tensor operations for supervised learning.

## KotlinRL is ideal for:

> Production JVM developers building runtime adaptive systems where feedback-driven decision making is required inside live microservices or JVM control loops.

## Why KotlinRL?

- JVM production systems need adaptive control agents.
- Python-based RL frameworks introduce complexity when embedding into JVM stacks.
- DJL gives us modern tensor and streaming data structures — KotlinRL builds the control logic on top.
